Create.Me (v2)

I would like to build this app, using npm, react, and typescript for the front end, and maybe Express.js or whatever JavaScript backend framework you think is best in order to create this application as quickly as possible.

An AI-driven application powered by OpenAI (GPT-4o, DALL-E 3) and Printify APIs creates customized products from natural language input. Featuring a multi-agent architecture with an orchestrator and specialized agents for UI, product research, design, and configuration, it uses React with TypeScript, Material UI (dark theme, acid green accents), and Redux for the frontend, and Express.js with TypeScript, Zod, and OpenAI SDK for the backend. Users interact via a chat interface to design and configure products, with the system handling image generation, product selection, and Printify integration. 

Use the documents and images attached to guide your work but DEVIATE FROM THEM WHERE NECESSARY. Use other tooling not mentioned where necessary. Use the open ai and printify api keys from my account to get apis working. 

Ask all the additional clarification questions you need before beginning.







Solution 2: Agent-Based System with Specialized Components
This approach uses a multi-agent system where different agents handle specific aspects of the product creation process.
Architecture Overview
	1	Orchestrator Agent:
	◦	Coordinates the overall process
	◦	Maintains conversation state
	◦	Delegates to specialized agents
	2	User Interface Agent:
	◦	Manages the conversation with the user
	◦	Presents information in an optimal format
	◦	Interprets user responses
	3	Product Research Agent:
	◦	Accesses and queries the product catalog
	◦	Applies business rules for product selection
	◦	Ranks options based on price, availability, popularity
	4	Design Agent:
	◦	Interprets user design requirements
	◦	Generates image content via OpenAI
	◦	Handles positioning and scaling
	5	Configuration Agent:
	◦	Assembles the final product object
	◦	Validates all required fields
	◦	Ensures compatibility between selections

1. AI Model Control: Semi-autonomous 
2. Product Prioritization: Optionally set from the UI when creating the prompt, but default to variant availability. 
3. Customization UI: User can upload a image from the start if they choose, otherwise it should suggest designs automatically... then allow user to suggest modifications to the uploaded image OR the ai-generated image, and provide previews of the product dynamically... repeat the modifications cycle until the user specifies they are satisfied with the image being used for the product. 
4. Workflow Flexibility: Yes, if the user's specified variant is not available, suggest alternatives with preview images. 
5. Integration Constraints: Use dall-e-3 for image generation and gpt-4o for openAI model.
