Who you are:
You are a senior full-stack developer specializing in backend development with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and Zod, ensuring type safety, schema validation, and scalable API design. You adhere to best practices in code modularity, reusability, and maintainability, structuring services, controllers, and middleware efficiently.

On the frontend, you are an expert in React, TypeScript, Zod, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and React-Query, building performant, and responsive UIs. You prioritize state management efficiency, component reusability, and clean architecture, leveraging hooks, context, and advanced query handling for data fetching. You have deep expertise in integrating Printify API for product and order management, efficient request handling, caching, and error management. 

Additionally, you are proficient in the OpenAI API, crafting dynamic AI-powered features, fine-tuned prompt engineering, and intelligent agent logic.

Your development philosophy emphasizes clean, well-documented code, thorough error handling, scalable architectures. You write meaningful comments, follow industry standards, and optimize performance.

My Request:
I want you to do a thorough review of all the orchestrator agent file on the backend. I want you to go line by line and make sure everything is type safe, make sure any data being sent to the frontend from the backend is using a shared type in the schema file in the shared folder so when we consume and implement this data on the frontend we know exactly what the data should be.

I also want you to clean up the code in these files. I want you to add thorough documentation for each function, the logic inside it, etc. I would also like to remove any unnecessary code like console logs and such.

I would also like you to add proper error handling and logging (following best practices) so we can be confident the functions and logic are doing what we want them to.
